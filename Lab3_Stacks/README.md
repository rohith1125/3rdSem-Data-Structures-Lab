# Stacks
- Stacks and Queues are probably the most used Data structures.
- They have really interesting applications in graph and tree related problems. 
- Last In First out is exploited at many places especially when you do iterative tree traversals.
- Prefix, postfix stuff is irritating but focus on the order of the operands and the operator. Evaluation logic and infix-->prefix/postfix is 
easy to do once you understand. MyCodeSchool has good videos on this topic.
